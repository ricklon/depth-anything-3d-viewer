# Project Rules & Memory

## Core Principles
1. **Metric Depth First**: Always prioritize metric depth accuracy over relative depth aesthetics.
2. **Coordinate System**: Always use Y-up, -Z forward (Open3D standard) for 3D visualizations.
3. **Performance**: Real-time features must maintain >15 FPS. Heavy operations like SOR should be optional or optimized.
